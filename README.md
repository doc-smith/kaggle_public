# kaggle_public

This repository contains solutions for following Kaggle competitions:
* [Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification) (25th/377)
* [CrowdFlower Search Results Relevance](https://www.kaggle.com/c/crowdflower-search-relevance) (38th/1326)

The code is highly experimental (just as all other Kaggle solutions) but still quite readable. For instance, see [the code](https://github.com/drsmithization/kaggle_public/blob/master/market/relevance.py) for computing some text relevance features.
